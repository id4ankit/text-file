PROJECTS

Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Autoencoder - Research Practice Jan 2024 - May 2024
Aim:
In this research practice, medical image analysis aims to identify and delineate a brain tumor's regions within an MRI or CT scan. The segmentation process involves separating the tumor area from the surrounding healthy tissue, which is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of the tumor progression. Variational Auto-encoder(VAE) is used to adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder, as well as the training time, to minimize reconstruction error.
Deep Learning: Aug 2024 - Dec2024
